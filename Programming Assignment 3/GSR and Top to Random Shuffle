#first method in the assignment
#Cut the deck such that the probability of grabbing k of the n cards with your left
##hand is (n choose k)/2**n. Then, move one card at a time, repeatedly, from the bottom of
##one hand to the top of the shuffled deck, such that if l cards remain on your left
##and r cards remain on your right, then the probability of choosing a card from
##your left is l/(l + r) and the probability of choosing a card from your right is
##r/(l + r). In other words, at any moment during the riffle, the probability that
##the card against your left thumb is the next to fall equals the proportion of the
##not-yet-fallen cards which are in your left hand.
